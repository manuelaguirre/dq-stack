Purpose: Start a quick demo as starting point for QUIZ player definition. 
         It embeds GPIO (buzzers emulation) that refer to Raspberry PI4, Mouse            for Touch screen emulation, sound player...
	 
Content: There are 2 main files:
	 + main.py : Start server part which manages web and client interfaces
	 + client_gui4.py : Start game on player host. It consumes questions.py                              file where all questions (2 for the moment) are  
	                    defined. The idea is that the admin, through back 
			    office platform, generates this file automatically  
			    before each game. Check the python file for details 
			    about the mapping of each field (question, answers, 
			    good match, image if exists...).
	 + icones (folder): for buttons definition and others...
	 + images (folder): for images to load during the game
	 + sounds (folder): for sounds to play if any
	 + fonts  (folder): In case specific fonts are provided
	 + templates (folder): index.html file template
			    
			
Process:
	 + Open 2 consoles (normally your RaspPI4 will be configured properly) 
	   From prompt1: python3.7 main.py from
	   From prompt2: python client_gui4.py
	   Note: do note consider the different version in use. Must be 
	   consistent (3.7 is the reference)
	 + Open your favorite internet browser and type http://192.168.0.xx:8080            (DHCP dependant). It displays interactively the response, status 
	   (lost/win) and score.
	 + Once the 2 python's files sourced a pop-up window appears with first 
	   question. 
	   You can manage buttons or mouse to select the good answer 
	   accordingly. If the answer is correct a sound (applause :-D) is 
	   played.
	   You can observe on right corner a timer (45mn) 
	   Between each question there is a tempo.
	   At the end a dark screen is displayed with time stamp performed and 
	   score.
